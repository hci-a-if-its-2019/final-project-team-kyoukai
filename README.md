## Prototyping 2.0
![Sketch 2.0](https://github.com/hci-a-if-its-2019/final-project-team-kyoukai/blob/master/Images/DSC_0002.JPG)

### Design Rationale
In our quest to lighten the former website, we cramped the current prototype. It seems that most users, especially beginners, does not like bulky tutorial website, but also does not like website that are practically choking them. There needs to be balance in webpage layout. We also found while sketching prototype 2.0 that it is very similar to our Sketch 2, so we used that in order to save time.
